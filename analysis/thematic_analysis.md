## Coding Methodology

### Approach: Deductive-Inductive Thematic Analysis
A combined approach was used where initial codes were developed from the research objectives (deductive), then refined based on patterns emerging from the data (inductive).

### Coding Process

1. **Initial Reading**: All 100 posts were read to gain familiarity with the dataset
2. **Open Coding**: Initial codes were assigned to each post based on content
3. **Axial Coding**: Codes were grouped into broader categories
4. **Theme Development**: Categories were organised into primary and secondary themes
5. **Validation**: Posts were re-reviewed to ensure consistent classification
